Using the Amazon EC2 API, please write code that does the following:

Launches an m3.medium load generator (ami-1810b270) with the correct tag
Launches an m3.medium data center instance (ami-324ae85a) with the correct tag
Please note that the instance tagging for steps 1 and 2 above must be done in your code, and not manually through the AWS web console.
Activate your instances by providing your username at the URLs:
http://<your-load-generator-instance-dns-name>/username/
http://<your-data-center-instance-dns-name>/username/
Submit the data center instanceâ€™s DNS name to:

http://<your-load-generator-instance-dns-name>/part/one/i/want/more/

To submit using code, you can request a URL like: http://<your-load-generator-instance-dns-name>/part/one/i/want/more?dns=ec2-54-165-107-16.compute.amazonaws.com&testId=Pizza


At this point, the load generator will start firing a massive amount of traffic to your instance. Unfortunately, a single m3.medium instance is incapable of handling this traffic. Every minute, you should see the updated performance (average requests per second) score at the URL: http://your-load-generator-instance-dns-name/view-logs?name= result_<yourusername>_<testid>.txt.


This page is updated every 60 seconds with the latest performance score.

To pass the final exam, your code should quickly scale up the number of instances in the data center. To do this, your code should perform Steps 2-5 (above), compute the cumulative average rps of all connected instances.

Your goal is for all instances in the data center to handle an aggregate of 3600 requests per second.
